# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

The Web Scraping Project is focused on data extraction from websites using Python's BeautifulSoup (`bs4`) module. The project demonstrates the process of web scraping and saving the scraped data to an Excel file. The result is a dataset named `amazon1.xlsx`, containing valuable information extracted from an Amazon web page.

## Project Components

### Web Scraping Code

- **webscraping.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used for web scraping. It employs the BeautifulSoup (`bs4`) library to parse and extract data from web pages. In this case, it scrapes data from an Amazon web page.

### Dataset

- **amazon1.xlsx:** This Excel file is the outcome of the web scraping process. It contains structured data from the Amazon web page, including product names, prices, and other relevant information.
